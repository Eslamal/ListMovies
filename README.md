## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the code scalable, maintainable, and testable.

-   **View (UI Layer):** Activities and Fragments are responsible only for displaying the UI and forwarding user events to the ViewModel.
-   **ViewModel:** Acts as the bridge between the UI and the data layer. It holds all UI-related logic and exposes data to the UI via `LiveData`.
-   **Repository:** Implements the Single Source of Truth principle. It is the sole manager of all app data, deciding whether to fetch it from a remote or local source.
-   **Data Sources:**
    -   **Remote:**
        -   **Retrofit:** For consuming the TMDb REST API.
    -   **Local:**
        -   **Room Persistence Library:** For local data storage (user lists like Favorites/Watchlist in guest mode) and caching.
